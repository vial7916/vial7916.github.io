            <p class="aboutport">During my sophmore year at CU Boulder, I took a course titled "Computational Foundations 1." Throughout this course, I was tasked with utilizing Python to complete various assignments. If you scroll on the image to the right, you will see screengrabs of projects that I completed throughout the class. </p>
            <p class="aboutport2">The assignments featured are Jeff Bezos Graffiti, Pseudo Pattern, Generative Art, Object Click Game, Interactive Game, and my Final Project. For the majority of assignments, I used the Turtle feature in Python to draw over images or a blank canvas. However, for the last few assignments we had to focus on user interactivity to create different types of games therefore I used buttons and click functions.</p>
            <p class="aboutport3">If you are interested in learning more about these assignments, please feel free to reach out to me!</p>
